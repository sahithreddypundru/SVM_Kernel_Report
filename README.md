## Project Description
This repository contains the report and code for analyzing Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels on synthetic datasets (Moons, Circles, Linear). The report demonstrates the effect of kernel choice on classification performance and includes visualizations of decision boundaries.
